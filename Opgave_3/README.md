#Opgave 3

Spørgsmål:

    "1. SQL DDL: Create a relational database for the administration of courses and exams in a computer science department at a university. Ideally, you can build on the relational schemas you created in the last hand-in. You are welcome to change and adapt the schema based on feedback from your TA or learning in the meantime. In case that you have some issues with your previous solution that you cannot resolve, you may request an example solution from your TA after the last hand-in deadline (12.9. kl. 6).

    Provide a list of DDL statements that you used to create tables, and provide comments for semantical meanings, attributes, constraints etc.

    2. Inserting data: Populate the tables that are used in the queries with a sufficient amount of data (at least several rows per table) so that the queries below get non-trivial answers.

    Provide the insert statements used, and a brief commentary.

    3. Write SQL queries that answer the following questions:

        Which students have received a grade that is 10 or lower?
        Which teachers have taught the same course?
        List each student together with the average grade for the student across all courses the student has taken.
        How many distinct average grades are there among students?

    Include the output of the queries run on your MySQL database.


    Please note: It is very important that you describe and explain what you are doing - a solution without proper discussion will NOT get full points.

    Hand in your answers in groups of 3 in a single file named point1.pdf (NOT e.g. Word or text format).

    The presentation exercises in your upcoming exercise sessions (starting Sep 9th) allow you to practice the material further before you hand-in.


    The hand-in deadlines per exercise group (and hand-in) are published as a table on the course schedule page. Please note that late hand-ins will NOT be graded (and thus do NOT count towards the exam grade)."
